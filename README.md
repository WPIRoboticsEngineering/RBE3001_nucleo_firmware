# RBE3001_nucleo_firmware

Welcome to the first RBE3001 lab session! This is going to be great!
Below you will find instructions to install and set up the firmware for the nucleo-f746zg board.
# BEGIN Private machine, not Lab machines
## Driver and udev rule
The nucleo needs a udev rule installed in

/etc/udev/rules.d/81-neuronrobotics.rules

```
wget https://github.com/WPIRoboticsEngineering/RBE3001_nucleo_firmware/releases/download/0.0.6/81-neuronrobotics.rules
sudo cp 81-neuronrobotics.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo  udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo adduser $USER dialout 
```
Udev for nucleo source

## Toolchains 
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:team-gcc-arm-embedded/ppa
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install gcc-arm-embedded automake libusb-1.0-0-dev putty libhidapi-dev python-pip libtool git oracle-java8-set-default oracle-java8-installer
sudo pip install mbed-cli
git clone http://repo.or.cz/r/openocd.git
cd openocd
./bootstrap
./configure --enable-stlink --enable-ftdi --enable-cmsis-dap --prefix=/usr/local
make -j8
sudo make install

```
# END Private machine, not Lab machines

Log out and log back in to make the user permissions stick.
# SSH Keys
To use the git@ url and to push without having to enter your username and password all the time, you need to set up an SSH key with github. 
follow these instructions https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/

then these  https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/
# Firmware Source Code

Download and compile the source code with mbed-cli
## Configure git
```
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@wpi.edu
```
## Check Git Configuration
List all configurations:
```
 git config --list
 
 ```
Check just for the user tags:
```
 git config --list|grep user
 
 ```
# Clone Firmware
A new private repository is created for every team. Check the URL of your repo by cloning it 
```
git clone MY_Private_Repo_URL_here
cd M-Repo_Folder
```
## Set up your private repo
```
#Set your fresh clean Private repo here
git remote set-url origin DO_NOT_COPY_THIS_REPLACE_IT_WITH_MY_Private_Repo_URL_here
git checkout master
# Add the example RBE firmware as an upstream pull
git remote add RBE-UPSTREAM https://github.com/WPIRoboticsEngineering/RBE3001_nucleo_firmware.git
```
## Initialize, Compile and Deploy the Firmware
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
mbed deploy
mbed-cli compile -j0 -t GCC_ARM -m nucleo_f746zg --source .  --source ./mbed-os/features/unsupported/USBDevice/USBDevice/  --source ./mbed-os/features/unsupported/USBDevice/USBHID/ -f
```
If everything worked your terminal should look like: 

![](/img/terminal.png)

If an error message shows up at the end of the build process, check that the board is connected to the computer and try again.

# Setting up Doxygen
```
doxygen doxy.doxygen
```
If successful a series of commands should scroll across the screen and once complete a docs folder should be generated comtaining an html folder.

# Print statements

Now we are going to verify the communication between the computer and the NUCLEO firmware. To do so, we will use putty to listen on the serial port ttyACM0:
```
putty -serial /dev/ttyACM0
```
If successful, you should now see the following:

# Install Eclipse (CDT)
[Direct Download Link for Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/oomph/epp/oxygen/R/eclipse-inst-linux64.tar.gz)

Extract and run the installer. Select C/C++ version of eclipse and install it in the default location. 

`eclipse-inst`

![](/img/eclipse.png)

To launch eclipse, go to where you installed eclipse

if you installed in it in the deault location run:

```
cd ~/eclipse/cpp-oxygen/eclipse
./eclipse
```
Optionally you can make an eclipse launcher
```
mkdir -p ~/bin/
echo "[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Type=Application
Name=Eclipse Arm Toolchain
Comment=
Exec=$HOME/eclipse/cpp-oxygen/eclipse/eclipse
Icon=$HOME/eclipse/cpp-oxygen/eclipse/icon.xpm

chmod +x ~/bin/EclipseARM.desktop
ln -s ~/bin/Eclipse.desktop ~/Desktop/EclipseARM.desktop
```

# Eclipse Setup

Create a workspace for you RBE3001 devlepmet. First, add the GNU ARM toolchain by clicking on the Help tab at the top of the screen and then clicking on the "Install New Software..." button within that tab. From there, add the following information:

Name: GNU ARM Eclipse Plug-ins

Location: `http://gnu-mcu-eclipse.netlify.com/v4-neon-updates`

Install plugins from that site. 

Restart Eclipse after installing plugins.

Next Set up the toolchain path for MCU's

Window->Preferences->MCU->Global ARM Toolchain Paths->Toolchain folder:

`/usr/arm-none-eabi/bin/`

Apply and Close

Set up a new project using "Importing to Eclipse and Building" section from: 

From the File menu:
Import... ->C/C++ -> Existing Code as Makefile Project

Browse in Existing Code Location for your RBE3001_Nucleo_firmware (This should set the project name as well

Select ARM Cross GCC

Finish

Then set the build command by right clicking on RBE3001_Nucleo_firmware

Select Properties->C/C++ Build

Builder Settings->Build Command:

`mbed-cli compile -j0 -t GCC_ARM -m nucleo_f746zg --source .  --source ./mbed-os/features/unsupported/USBDevice/USBDevice/  --source ./mbed-os/features/unsupported/USBDevice/USBHID/`

![](/img/Screenshot_2017-08-21_12-50-00.png)


Set the build command to push the firmware with '-f'

Properties->C/C++ Build->Behavior Build(Incremental Build)

![](/img/Screenshot_2017-08-21_12-43-41.png)
# Fix the errors for standard types (Red underlines in HIDDevice.h and all others with stdint)
right click on RBE3001_Nucleo_firmware 

Properties->C/C++ Build ->Settings->Toolchains->Toolchain path

and make sure it says:

`/usr/arm-none-eabi/bin/`

Click apply and Save from this window. This writes the toolchain into the configuration and causes a re-index. THis step is nessissary. 

right click on RBE3001_Nucleo_firmware

Index-> Rebuild

Wait for the C/C++ indexer to complete and then you can begin working.

**Congratulations! You have completed the setup of the NUCLEO firmware!**


# Core firmware maintainance and bug reporting
## Upstream updates
If the course staff needs to update or repair any system code or the dependant libraries, then you will need to run:
```
git pull RBE-UPSTREAM master
git submodule init
git submodule update
cd lib/AS5050/
git pull origin master
cd ..
cd lib/MbedPwmServo/
git pull origin master
cd ..
cd lib/PID_Bowler/
git pull origin master
cd ..
cd lib/SimplePacketComs/
git pull origin master
cd ..
```

## Reporting Issues with the template code

To report an issue with the template code it must consist of these exact elements:

A public fork of the template code from the current master with the error demonstrated with a unit test demonstration. Only the necessary code to demonstrate the bug. 9 times out of 10, when doing this you will find the bug or a faster workaround to unexpected behavior. If the bug can be demonstrated in isolation then move on to the next step. DO Not just copy your whole project over, make a new set of code demonstrating only the problem and nothing else. Each line must have a comment on the end explaining why it needs to be ther in order to demonstrate the bug. This will be visible in the github diff as each line having a comment after the end of the line. If you demonstration does not meet these criteria, the issue will wait until you commit updates making the repo meet them. 

An Issue posted here: https://github.com/WPIRoboticsEngineering/RBE3001_nucleo_firmware/issues and a link to the repository with the demonstration code. Simply describing a problem without the isolated demonstration code will cause the issue to be closed. The issue will be reviewed and a patch or response with happen as soon as the staff figures out whats wrong. If you would like to suggest a solution, feel free to send a Pull Request with a clean branch of the solution to the issue. Be sure to include the issue number, such as #1 , in all commits resolving this issue.
