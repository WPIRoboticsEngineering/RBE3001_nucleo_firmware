 * @brief PidServer for the RBE3001 robotic arm
 * 
 * @section RBE3001 - Nucleo Firmware - PidServer
 *
 * Instructions
 * ------------
 * This class implements a communication server that can be
 * used to send given setpoints (in joint space) to the robotic arm.
 * Setpoints generated in MATLAB and sent over HDI will be made available
 * to the `event()' function below. See the code in `PidServer.cpp' for
 * for more details.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT - Multiple communication servers can run in parallel, as shown
 *             in the main file of this firmware
 *             (see 'Part 2b' in /src/Main.cpp). To ensure that communication
 *             packets generated in MATLAB are routed to the appropriate 
 *             server, we use unique identifiers. The identifier for this
 *             server is the integer number 37.
 *             In general, the identifier can be any 4-byte unsigned
 *             integer number.
